The purpose of the chatbot is to make a
conversation between both humans and machine. Chatbots
were initially made using the concepts of machine learning
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and it had some
flaws in it. In order to overcome those problems, we are
using some deep learning techniques with NLP to create
an advance chatbot. Chatbots are the latest technologies
created for the modern world. Chatbots uses the concept
of NLP to communicate and share data. The way they are
trained and the methods that are implemented to make
the conversation sensible and reasonable is stated. The
machine has been trained with certain knowledge to figure
out the sentences and deciding by its own to generate a
response to answer a question. The response should be
matching to the input sentence from user. From the input
sentence, it will perform certain calculations to get the
similarity of sentences. This paper provides an overview
of some modern deep learning techniques that were used
to build the chatbots. The methods of Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM)
are implemented in our model to generate the outputs.
